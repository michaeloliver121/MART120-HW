Here is my Final Project Proposal, as well as some thoughts and challenges I might face:

I have been pretty interested in space and planetary bodies recently, so I think that it would be cool while also not being too out of my skillset to create a working, accurate solar system model. I want to have each planetary body orbiting the sun, with accurate speed and scales. I also would like to show the orbital lines, as well as different moons. With this, I think it would be interesting to be able to hover over a planet/moon and not only have the whole animation stop, but give information on the planet if you are interested in learning.

I was actually a little inspired by the examples provided; the one by Stephen Brown specifically. I saw the colors and the sphere in the middle and immediately thought of space, so I would like to create something similar. but with my concept in mind.

I think one of the major things that I'll have to learn is how to create a moving object with another moving object tied/attached to it. This is going to be the premise of my concept and I'll need to find out how to have those relationships. I also am going to need to figure out how to stop everything when you hover with your mouse on an object, as well as bring up some sort of UI to give information. This is all going to be somewhat new to me so I am curious how this will go.

I will probably work on this for a bit every day to be able to make the time crunch. I am currently in recovery for a pretty intrusive facial surgery so I am just trying to take it easy before committing to this final and the rest of my finals. However, I think it'll be easier for me to break up my work into chunks:

    - Artwork for planets
    - Diagram creation
    - Planetary Movements
    - UI
    - Sounds?

Like I said above, I have not started yet since I had a major surgery and have been in recovery since then. I should be up and running again by hopefull wednesday, but regardless I'll be recovering for about a month or so living off of meds for the time being.

I will keep this updated with any new info in the timeline if stuff changes.
