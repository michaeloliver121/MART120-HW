A GUI and a CLI are actually relatively similar since they inherently allow you to do the same things for the most part. A Graphical User Interface, obvious in the name, gives a user the ability to visualize graphics to be able to manipulate code. We are able to create folders and different files, and the visualization has a very low barrier to entry, as we can see what we are actively working with and using graphics to help visualize the changes we make and the files we create. On the downside though, since this is user friendly and accessible to all, a GUI doesn't necessarily have all of the same capabilities as a CLI has, due to potential risk in disrupting OS interactions. This is where a CLI would come into play. A CLI is much less user friendly (the black box and matrix-style letters definitely add a scare factor) as everything is text-based. However, this creates a much faster and workable environment for a user due to not having to deal with visualizing folders and directories. Using text commands, we can browse, add, delete, and edit files in a quicker manner than navigating through folders on the desktop. This also allows us to use different commands to actually edit the structure and format of different computer systems and can give us a more complex look into the framework of an OS than a GUI can show us.
