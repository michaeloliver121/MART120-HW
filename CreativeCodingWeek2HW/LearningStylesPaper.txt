I think that learning styles exist, otherwise we wouldn't have categorized them so. Everyone is different and our own individual personalities and traits mean that we all learn things a little differently. Some people like to view things, and learning visually is appealing to them for their own reasons. Maybe it's because they don't like speaking out loud or they just feel more comfortable without bringing attention to themselves. Other people might not like this type of learning if it doesn't work for them. You might be a tactile learner for different reasons. Everyone has a different style that suits them more and I don't think any learning style is worse than others, as it's all a part of perspective. I think the important thing with learning styles is being able to cater to each person's style, or at least allow that person to learn in the way that works for them if they make an effort. I also think that learning what aspect works best for you in specific scenarios is a good way to not only self reflect, but to also potentially grow your mindset. You might not have ever tried to learn things audibly, so give it a shot and see if it works for you. If it doesn't it at least lets you know what it is like for learners that prefer that methodology. Growing is allowing your preconceived notions the freedom to change and adjust based on what works best for you.
